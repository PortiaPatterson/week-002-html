# Dynamic Parts of the Webpage
The webpage will need quite a bit of added functionality to make it work as it should, such as:

1. When new tasks typed into the text box area and the "ADD" button is clicked, this should somehow populate the table lower down on the page that shows what tasks need to be completed.

2. The number that is next to the text "Things To Do" is currently hard coded, but this should be totalled or populated dynamically so that it shows the right number of tasks.

3. The buttons that allow you to click whether a task is DONE or DELETED, need to have some action so that a task's status is clear.

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:

1. There is no Validation on the text box area where you type in new tasks; this could mean that people might miss it out or type in the wrong kind of details or put in too much text. To avoid this we could:

Make the text box a Required or Mandatory Field so that people would have to fill it in.

Set the String Length so that only a certain amount of text can be added.

Add some tips or hints at the side of the box to help people understand the kinds of details they should be putting in.

Possibly use a drop down list that is populated with a set list of typical tasks that people might want to add; this may help to reduce typing errors or the wrong info being added.

2. There is no Navigation Bar which would help people to move around the page better; it could also do with some details about what the page is for.

3. Until the Task entry text box, the Things To Do number and the buttons to click ADD, DONE or DELETE have code behind them to either populate the table, update the number of tasks or submit the actions from the buttons there is no actual way of completing them.
